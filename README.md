# COGS-for-Makers
A simple Cost-of-Goods / Cost-of-Goods-Sold Calculator for Makers to help identify what time and costs make up a product.
It is populated with sample data for a laser-cut puzzle. Grey cells are calculated values. 

One might think that with a puzzle made from hardboard (which is cheap) and laser cutting at a resonable per-minute price, $29 should allow for a healthy profit. But not so! As you can see, as things stand the profit margin is lower than 50% for online sales (but much better for in-person sales.) How does this happen?

Thanks to the spreadsheet, one can see that the lion's share of the costs are in processing the raw materials, and in shipping costs.
Right away this tells you that optimizing the cost of laser cutting or optimizing shipping cost would be the prime areas to address. Including free shipping in the price is expensive! One could also simply raise the price...

While <50% profit margin is not very healthy, it shows that at least you should be able to make and sell them at shows or online and not LOSE money.

The formulas handle the different cells in specific ways, so be careful when modifying for your own uses unless you change only the values. If you add new cells you'll definitely need to modify the formulas for the grey cells.

The organization and layout is intended to make the process of understanding where costs and time are spent on a product more clear.
